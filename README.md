## 3. Review Information

![Screenshot 2024-11-18 104118](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fe2af33-fcd4-4e44-99b9-b3f1ad2e470a)

This dashboard presents a comprehensive analysis of book reviews, showcasing various aspects such as total review count, average rating, review sentiment, age group distribution, and book category breakdown. Below is a summary report detailing the insights derived from each visual component:

### Overview and Key Metrics

The dashboard indicates a total of 200 reviews with an average rating of 3.06 out of 5. This suggests a mixed reception among reviewers, with room for improvement in satisfaction levels.

#### Review Sentiment Analysis

The pie chart titled "Count of Review Date by Review Sentiment" categorizes reviews based on sentiment—positive, neutral, and negative. Out of the 200 reviews, 36% are neutral (72 reviews), 34.5% are negative (69 reviews), and the remaining portion consists of positive reviews. This distribution implies that the sentiment is somewhat polarized, with a slight skew towards neutral and negative opinions.

#### Rating Distribution by Book Category

The bar chart "Count of Rating by Book Category" reveals the distribution of ratings across different book categories. Biographies and Self-Help books receive the highest counts of ratings, suggesting a higher level of interest or popularity in these genres. Other categories like Children's Books, Bible, Fiction, and Non-Fiction have comparatively fewer reviews, indicating that these may appeal to a smaller audience.

#### Age Group and Rating Correlation

The "Average of Rating by Reviewer Age Group" pie chart provides insights into how different age groups rate books. The 60+ age group has the highest average rating (3.27), followed by the 36-45 age group at 3.17. Younger audiences (under 18 and 18-25 age groups) tend to give slightly lower ratings. This could indicate differing expectations or preferences across age demographics, with older audiences being more favourable in their reviews.

#### Review Volume by Book Category

The bar chart "Sum of Review Date by Book Category" compares the volume of reviews by category. Biography and Self-Help categories lead in review volume, while Fiction and Non-Fiction categories lag. This insight aligns with the earlier observation of higher rating counts in Biography and Self-Help, reinforcing the popularity of these genres among reviewers.

## 4. Analysis of Branch Information Dashboard

### Overview

Below we have four charts on our Branch Dashboard. We compare the Stock Turnover, Revenue per Bible Category, Profit, and the Expenses per branch and henceforth, discuss the key insights derived from each chart, how it helps in attaining the business’ ultimate goal (growth), and give ways in which they could tweak their strategy to grow one step closer to their goal.

#### Donut chart on Stock Turnover per branch
![Screenshot 2024-11-22 091839](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58694348-ca4e-4f09-83e3-1f17cabc121d)

From the Keswick data, below are some insights that were gathered from the following Donut Chart Visualization: 

	The Kilimani branch should continue to be prioritized in inventory management to maintain its top performance. Keeping their stock high will ensure no gaps in product availability and in turn guarantee a happy, loyal, and retained customer-base.

	For Nakuru’s low turnover (13.89%), further follow-up should be done to see why the turnover is as low as it is; maybe marketing efforts are poor, or customer engagement is not high for this specific location. Understanding and addressing this would ultimately help them re-strategize and eventually grow their customer-base.


	Ensuring stock allocation reflects the demand at Ngong Road, Mombasa, and CBD to sustain their contributions would help the business sustain their current customer base by essentially making sure that stock is never low on high-demand Bibles.

#### Clustered Bar Chart on Revenue per Bible Category per Branch
![Screenshot 2024-11-22 091901](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b1a453f-3eae-4abc-b252-3c9fe7114b40)

In this section, we get into comparing the revenue generated per book category in each branch. This is helpful in the various ways listed below:

	Ensuring Mombasa has ample supply of Study Bibles will ensure sustenance of its strong performance, ensuring a steady growth rate.

	Focusing on Branch-Specific Needs by increasing stock for Children’s Bibles at Ngong Road and Pocket Bibles at the CBD to match demand patterns keeps a happy, returning customer base and could potentially lead to growth due to clear evidence of a reliable business, attentive to their customers’ needs.

	In tandem with enhancing marketing efforts, assessing local demand for Children and Family Bibles to boost overall performance in this branch.

	Developing category-specific promotions whereby popular features of Study and Pocket Bibles would be highlighted to drive sales across branches.


#### Clustered column chart on expense amount per Expense Type & Branch
![Screenshot 2024-11-22 091926](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32338a86-6725-4acf-a727-2493838129b6)

Here, we get into the breakdown of Keswick’s expenditure across its branches per expense type (Salaries, rent, utilities and maintenance). Analysing these helps us find out which areas the business can cut back costs on and reinvest that money into someplace else.

	CBD spends the most on salaries, Kilimani on maintenance, whereas Mombasa and Ngong Rd have a more balanced expenditure but focus on salaries. Nakuru spends a lot on salaries but the least on utilities. 

	What can help to reduce certain expenditures, take rent as an example, is perhaps exploring opportunities to renegotiate their rent contracts or assessing whether their current branch locations are cost-effective. Furthermore, for salaries, analysing whether staffing levels align with each branch's performance and adjust accordingly to balance costs, and productivity could prove to be useful.

	At high-expense branches (Kilimani and CBD), increasing sales would be beneficial to the business to offset their higher operational costs (salaries, maintenance, etc.). This can be achieved by running targeted ads to drive up more customer traffic. 


#### Pie Chart on Profit per Branch
![Screenshot 2024-11-22 091941](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d63d97a0-36b9-42e9-adfe-8cac37c71282)

Lastly, we have our profit comparison chart showcasing the performance of each branch in terms of the profit they bring in for the business. 

 	CBD contributes the highest average profit (33.79%), making it the most lucrative branch. This means it has strong customer engagement and effective stock or marketing strategies.

	Mombasa (21.06%) and Kilimani (17.54%) are the next most profitable branches, showing moderate profitability with room for growth.

	Nakuru (14.32%) and Ngong Rd (13.3%) are the least profitable, suggesting challenges in these locations, maybe due to lower sales or higher operational inefficiencies.

Advice:

	Invest more in high-performing branches like Mombasa while addressing operational inefficiencies in lower-performing locations.

	Organize in-branch events, such as Bible study sessions or community discussions, to drive foot traffic and loyalty.

## 5. Analysis of CLV Dashboard Breakdown

![Screenshot 2024-11-22 091405](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbc5fe2e-a62d-4a4c-bd9f-ec366ce0f9df)

The CLV (Customer Lifetime Value) dashboard contains purely the customer lifetime Matrix that allows us to draw insights on Keswick’s customer retention rates.

	As can be seen, the data mostly concentrates on customer orders of the last quarter of the year 2023. Here, we see that First Orders wrack up the highest amount in orders at over $300K. 

	However, as time goes on, returning customers dwindle, leaving the highest return period at 8 times since the first order, indicating a worrying trend; lack of customer retention. This may need some brainstorming from managers of the business.

	Our take on the matter would be to:

	 Increase their product range, i.e., perhaps to Christian fictional Literature (e-books, physical books, audiobooks, bookmarks, etc.), if the business is very firm about staying a strictly Christian brand, otherwise, perhaps venturing into selling non-Christian fictional literature (contemporary romance, Sci-fi, etc.) may help them reach a wider audience.

	As mentioned previously, organizing events, like Bible study sessions or community discussions, would drive foot traffic and definitely help increase customer loyalty and retention as the business would create a unique bond with its customer base in this special way.
